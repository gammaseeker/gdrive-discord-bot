# Gdrive Discord Bot
A discord bot that links google drive links.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide value to my engineering
fraternity, Theta Tau, in the form of improving their productivity.
Like any campus organization, many documents are stored via 
google drive. However the issue arises when you have so many 
documents over the years, it becomes very difficult to remember:
1) Where these google drives are located
2) Which google drive to access
3) The fact that these google drives exist (we're all busy students)
